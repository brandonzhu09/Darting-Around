### About
A travel planning site that tracks flight and hotel bookings, car rentals, and an itinerary recommendation feature that constructs a travel plan based on the answers given from a short questionnaire form. Flight, hotel, and car data are all requested externally using the Amadeus Global Distribution System (GDS) API that connects virtually every major travel agency, including major airlines and car rental companies.
